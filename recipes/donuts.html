<h2>Ingredients (6 Donuts)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>270 g flour (2 1/4 cups)</li>
    <li>125 ml Milk (0.5 cup)</li>
    <li>1 Egg</li>
    <li>1 tbsp acitive dry Yeast</li>
    <li>50 grams butter(1/4 cup)</li>
    <li>25g Sugar (2 tbsps)</li>
    <li>Sprinkle of Salt </li>
    <li>1 tsp Vanilla</li>        
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put the flour, the sugar, the yeast and the butter (at room temperature) into a big bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the vanilla and the egg</li>
    <li>Use a mixer to knead the dough at low speed to avoid flour ventilation</li>
    You can also knead it manually. It is a sticky dough but don't try to add extra flour so that it stays fluffy.
    <li>We add milk slowly while kneading</li>
    <li>Keep kneading for 10-15 minutes until the dough is soft</li>
    <li>Put the dough in a bowl with a wipe of oil and let it rest for 1-2 hours till the size doubles</li>
    <li>Roll the dough out to 1.5 cm thickness, cut into circles and cut into holes</li>
    <li>Let the donuts rest for other 30-45 minutes</li>
    <li>Prepare the oil. Using a heavy-bottomed pot heat oil to 160Â°C</li>
    <li>Fry the donuts for 2-3 minutes on each side then remove</li>
</ol>
